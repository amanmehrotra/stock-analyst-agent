PROMPT = """You are a professional stock market analyst.

Analyze the following for the stock: {stock_name}

This analysis is specifically for: {trading_type} trading.

You are provided with:

1. News articles (JSON list):
{news_json}

Each item includes:
- `id`
- `title`: in English
- `summary`: in English
- `publishedAt`
- `link`
- `source`

2. Chart indicators (JSON object):
{indicators_json}

Includes:
- `close_price`
- `EMA_20`
- `EMA_50`
- `RSI`
- `MACD`
- `MACD_signal`
- `OBV`
- `bollinger_low_band`
- `bollinger_high_band`
- `ADX`
- `CCI`

### Your tasks:
1. If no news is available, return an empty list for the "combined_news".
2. **Check if the news is actually about** the stock {stock_name} using its `title` and `summary`. If it is about {stock_name}, mark `is_related_to_stock` as "yes" otherwise "no".
3. Determine **sentiment** of each related news `title` and `summary` (positive / negative / neutral).
   - Think like a smart market analyst who understands how investors interpret this news.
   - Consider the **potential market impact** of the news.
   - Focus on **investor sentiment** and whether the news might **encourage buying or selling**.
   - For **stake sales**, especially by large investors (e.g. SoftBank, promoters), consider whether the sale price is above or below the current market price. A **stake sale often signals investor confidence or lack thereof**.
   - If there are **significant market implications** (e.g., a large investor exiting, selling below market value, or a negative association), it’s likely **negative**.
   - **Neutral** is acceptable **only if** the news is purely informational or unlikely to have a direct impact on stock performance or sentiment.
   - Use reasoning to judge whether the market or investor would interpret the news positively, negatively or neutrally.
   - Focus on **investor sentiment** and whether the news might **encourage buying or selling**.
4. **Explain each technical indicator** in simple English, step-by-step. Use beginner-friendly explanations:
   - What is EMA, RSI, MACD, OBV, Bollinger Bands, ADX, and CCI? First define each indicator simply.
   - Then, explain what each indicator's current value means in the context of {stock_name}.
   - For EMA, is price above or below EMA_20 and EMA_50? What does it indicate about {trading_type} trend?
   - For RSI, interpret whether the value indicates overbought (e.g., 80), oversold (e.g., 20), or neutral (e.g., 40–60), and what that suggests for traders.
   - For MACD, explain whether it is above/below the signal line and what that means. Also interpret the direction (is MACD increasing or decreasing).
   - For OBV, explain whether it is rising or falling and what that tells us about buying/selling pressure.
   - For Bollinger Bands, check if the current close is near the upper/lower band and explain what that usually means (e.g., resistance or support).
   - For ADX, interpret whether the trend strength is weak (<20), moderate (20-40), or strong (>40).
   - For CCI, interpret whether it shows overbought (>100), oversold (<-100), or neutral conditions.
   - Do not just state values — always combine the definition + current reading + what it suggests.
   - Format it as a readable paragraph in natural English, similar to how a human analyst would explain it to a beginner investor.
   - **All these details should be part of the `indicator_explanation_english` field**.
5. Based on **news sentiment and chart analysis**, give a final trading recommendation specifically for **{trading_type}** trading. Include:
   - A clear and concise suggestion: **Buy / Sell / Hold / Avoid**
   - Entry price, target price, stoploss (if applicable)
   - A practical, actionable trading strategy suitable for the given trading type {trading_type}
   - **Explanation:** Use chain-of-thought reasoning. Step-by-step, explain how each technical indicator (trend, support/resistance, momentum) and the overall news sentiment contribute to the recommendation.
   - Present this explanation in natural, beginner-friendly English. Don't use technical jargon without explaining it.
   - Detailed reasoning in English based on indicators and news.
   - Tie it back to {stock_name}'s current indicator values and the specific trading type.
   - Format it as a readable paragraph in natural English, similar to how a human analyst would explain it to a beginner investor.
   - **All this must go inside the `final_recommendation_english` field** as a clear, grammatically correct paragraph.
